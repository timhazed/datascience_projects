# Projects

## Pandas and Visualization (Food Hub)
The food aggregator company has stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to draw some actionable insights for the business. Suppose you are hired as a Data Scientist in this company and the Data Science team has shared some of the key questions that need to be answered. Perform the data analysis to find answers to these questions that will help the company to improve the business.

### Skills and Tools
Exploratory Data Analysis (Variable Identification, Univariate analysis, Bi-Variate analysis), Python

## Hypothesis Testing (ENews)
This project used statistical analysis, a/b testing, and visualization to decide whether the new landing page of an online news portal (E-news Express) is effective enough to gather new subscribers or not. The simulated dataset has certain important metrics such as converted status and time spent on the page that will help to conclude the effectiveness of the new landing page. Apart from that, the dependence of conversion on the preferred language will also be analyzed in this project.

### Skills and Tools

Hypothesis Testing, a/b testing, Data Visualization, Statistical Inference

## Linear Regression (ReCell)
Analyze the used devices dataset, build a model which will help develop a dynamic pricing strategy for used and refurbished devices, and identify factors that significantly influence the price.

### Skills and Tools

EDA, Linear Regression, Linear Regression assumptions, Business insights and recommendations

## Logistic Regression and Decision Trees (INN Hotels)
Analyze the data of INN Hotels to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations, build a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance, and help in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.

### Skills and Tools

EDA, Data Pre-processing, Logistic regression, Multicollinearity, Finding optimal threshold using AUC-ROC curve, Decision trees, Pruning

## Ensemble Techniques (Easy Visa)

Analyze the data of Visa applicants, build a predictive model to facilitate the process of visa approvals, and based on important factors that significantly influence the Visa status recommend a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied.
### Skills and Tools

EDA, Data Pre-processing, Boosting, Bagging, Stacking, Hypertuning

## Pipelining and Hypertuning Techniques (ReneWind)

"ReneWind" is a company working on improving the machinery/processes involved in the production of wind energy using machine learning and has collected data of generator failure of wind turbines using sensors. The objective is to build various classification models, tune them and find the best one that will help identify failures so that the generator could be repaired before failing/breaking and the overall maintenance cost of the generators can be brought down.
### Skills and Tools

EDA, Scaling, Regularization, Oversampling, Undersampling, Imputation, Pipelining, Hypertuning

## Unsupervised Learning (Trade&Ahead)
Analyze the stocks data, grouping the stocks based on the attributes provided, and sharing insights about the characteristics of each group.

### Skills and Tools
Unsupervised Learning, PCA, t-SNE, KMeans, Hierarchical Clustering

## Neural Networks (INN Bank Churn)
Businesses like banks that provide service have to worry about the problem of 'Churn' i.e. customers leaving and joining another service provider. It is important to understand which aspects of the service influence a customer's decision in this regard. Management can concentrate efforts on the improvement of service, keeping in mind these priorities. Provide a thorough analysis identifying whether or not customer will leave (churn in the next 6 months).

### Skills and Tools
Neural Networks, Tensorflow, Keras, SHAP
